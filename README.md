By default, the client will try to request a file named "example.txt" from the server running on the same machine (localhost). You can modify the `request_file` function call in the client script to specify a different filename, host, or port.

To test this setup:

1. Create a file named "example.txt" in the same directory as the server script.
2. Run the server script on one terminal.
3. Run the client script on another terminal.


The client will request "example.txt" from the server, and if the file exists, it will be transferred and saved as "received_example.txt" in the client's directory.

This implementation demonstrates the basic concepts of file transfer in a client-server network:

1. The server listens for incoming connections.
2. The client initiates a connection and requests a specific file.
3. The server checks if the file exists, sends its size, and then transfers the file in chunks.
4. The client receives the file size, creates a new file, and receives the data in chunks until the entire file is transferred.


Remember that this is a basic implementation and doesn't include error handling, security measures, or support for multiple simultaneous connections. In a production environment, you'd want to add these features and possibly use higher-level libraries or frameworks for more robust file transfer capabilities.

Here's how to use these scripts:

1. Run the server script on the machine that will act as the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

2. On the client machine, run the client script:
```bash
python client.py
```
